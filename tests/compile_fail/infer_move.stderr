error[E0373]: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `a`, which is owned by the current function
  --> tests/compile_fail/infer_move.rs:12:9
   |
12 |         || { a += 2; a }
   |         ^^   - `a` is borrowed here
   |         |
   |         may outlive borrowed value `a`
   |
note: function requires argument type to outlive `'static`
  --> tests/compile_fail/infer_move.rs:10:13

10 |       let _ = takes_static(capture!(
   |  _____________^
11 | |         all a,
12 | |         || { a += 2; a }
13 | |     ));
   | |______^
help: to force the closure to take ownership of `a` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword
   |
12 |         move || { a += 2; a }
   |         ++++
