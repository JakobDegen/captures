# More Powerful Closure Captures

This crate provides simple macros letting you express more powerful closure captures. These macros
allow you to capture by value, by arbitrary expression, or by reference, allow you to override the
Edition-2021 capture semantics, and allow you to ensure that no variables besides the ones you
specify are captured. See [the full documentation][documentation].
